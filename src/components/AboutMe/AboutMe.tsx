              I am a Computer Engineering student in my final semester, passionate about Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Web Development. I discovered my love for coding during my studies and enjoy building projects that challenge me to learn and solve complex problems.<br/>
               I have gained hands-on experience as a working student in DevOps, QA, and AI-driven projects at Infineon and Intive. In addition, I enjoy creating personal projects such as web applications and AI-driven prototypes that allow me to explore new technologies. Outside of tech, I am a passionate basketball player who values teamwork and continuous improvement, qualities that also shape how I approach my work.
