              I'm a Computer Engineering student in my final semester, passionate about Cloud Computing,
              DevOps, and Web Development. During my studies, I discovered my enthusiasm for coding
              and quickly realized how much I enjoy turning ideas into real, functional projects.<br/>

              Through my work as a working student at Infineon and Intive, I have gained hands-on experience
              in DevOps, QA, and AI-driven projects. This includes building deployment pipelines and contributing
              to machine learning applications. In my personal projects, I also like to explore new technologies
              to bring creative ideas to life.<br/>

              Outside of tech, I'm a passionate basketball player who enjoys all kinds of athletic activities.
              The teamwork, discipline, and focus it requires are the same values I bring into my professional work life.
